# The AI Jazz Composer

An adapted Transformer-XL deep learning model that composes Jazz music  (lead sheets&mdash;_chord progression & melody_).

## Usage Notes
### Prerequisites
 * **Python 3.6** ([install](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/))
 * _Recommended_: a working GPU with &geq;2GB of memory
 * Install dependencies (``pip`` or ``pip3``, depending on your sytem)
  ```shell
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
### Compose Some Songs Right Away
  * Inference (compose)
  ```shell
  python3 inference.py [--model MODEL] [--temp TEMP] [--struct_csv CSV] [--n_bars N_BARS] output_midi
  ```
  * ``output_midi``:  path to the output MIDI file
  * ``--model MODEL``:    path to the trained model checkpoint (default: the downloaded checkpoint)  
  * ``--temp TEMP``:      sampling temperature for generation (default: ``1.2``)
  * ``--n_bars N_BARS``:      # of bars to generate (default: ``32``)  
  * ``--struct_csv CSV ``:       path to the output csv file that records generated structure-related events (optional)


### Train from Scratch
  * Preprocess dataset
  ```
  ./data_preprocess.sh
  ```
  * Train the model
  ```
  python3 train.py ckpt_dir log_file
  ```
  * ``ckpt_dir``:  directory to save checkpoints  
  * ``log_file``:             path to the log file  
  
  Likewise, you may compose music with the model trained by yourself using ``inference.py`` (see above for instructions)
